YUI2 Example - Adding an updatable Footer to a DataTable (non-scrolling)

This is a simple example that shows how to create a footer for a standard non-scrolling DataTable
in YUI2.  As changes are made to data, like cell editing or record inserts or deletions, the footer 
will update it's values.  Also, as columns are resized the footer will resize accordingly.
(If you want to see a scrolling-DT footer there is another posting here:https://github.com/stlsmiths/YUI2-Scrolling-DataTable-Footer)

The technique is very straightforward, and based upon Satyam's method (see http://www.satyam.com.ar/yui/2.6.0/invoice.html).

A TFOOT Dom element is added to the bottom of the DataTable's TBODY, the heading for footer is a TH and 
the columns we wish to display are TD's.  

The only trick here, and where I differ from Satyam's example, is I define a listener attached to the 
DataTable's "postRenderEvent" to update the footer contents.  This is handy because "postRender" fires 
whenever a column re-sorts, cell edits, etc... basically anytime a change is made to the underlying recordset.

A live working example (fully documented) of this is available here : http://www.blunderalong.com/pub/dt_noscroll_foot.html

This has been tested in FF 3.5, Safari, Chrome and IE 7/9.

NOTE:  The code sample here is for reference, I haven't included the non-essential example CSS or syntax highlighter 
libraries.
